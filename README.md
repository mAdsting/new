I was able to host and deploy my website on github pages however experienced many challenges including time I might have chosen something biggger than I could handle plus experienced technical problems towards the end 
The website is up and running however its not fully complete but it is presentable
link to my website is https://madsting.github.io/new/
Its a website that sells luxury villas, yachts and jets
